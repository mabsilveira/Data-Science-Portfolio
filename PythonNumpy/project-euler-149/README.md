# Project euler problem 149

__Searching for a maximum-sum subsequence__

Find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in any direction of a 2000Ã—2000 table
filled with pseudo-random numbers obtained with the Lagged Fibonacci Generator

This script uses the Numpy module to solve it

Fritst the Lagged Fibonacci Generator is tested for the exemples provided

Then the matrix is search row by row and column by column and finally the diagionals to find the maximum sum.
